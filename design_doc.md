Design Document: AI Media Creation App 
1. 🌟 Overview and Goals
App Name (Placeholder): CreativeFlow

Target Audience: Digital artists, content creators, social media users, and anyone interested in AI image/video generation.

Core Goal: To create an intuitive, visually fresh, and engaging mobile (iOS/Android) or web application that allows users to easily find inspiration, generate unique AI-powered media (images and videos), and manage their creations using Flutter. 

2. ✨ Aesthetic and Technical Requirements (NEW SECTION)
Overall Style: Fresh and light primary aesthetic, focusing on clean lines, ample negative space, and a modern, airy feel.

Color Palette: Use a light background (e.g., white or very light gray) accented by blue highlights. The blue should be vibrant and used strategically for interactive elements.

Visual Effects:

Glow: Buttons and key interactive elements must feature a subtle blue glow effect upon interaction (hover/press) to indicate their function and add a premium feel.

Animations: Implement smooth, purposeful animations on buttons and navigation transitions.

Parallax Background: A subtle, cool-looking moving parallax background should be incorporated into main screens (e.g., Generator, Inspiration) to add depth without distracting from the content. This background should align with the blue-highlight theme (e.g., abstract glowing lines or particles).
